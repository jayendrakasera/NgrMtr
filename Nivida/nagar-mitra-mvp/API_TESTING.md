# Nagar Mitra API Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Nagar Mitra API using curl commands.

## Prerequisites

1. Backend server running at `http://localhost:8000`
2. Database initialized with sample data (`python init_db.py`)
3. curl or similar HTTP client

## Testing Workflow

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/health"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Nagar Mitra API"
}
```

### 2. User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mobile_number": "+919123456789",
    "name": "Test User",

## Interactive Testing

1. **Use API Documentation**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` for interactive testing
2. **Postman Collection**: Import the endpoints into Postman for easier testing
3. **Frontend Integration**: Test through the React frontend once developed

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. CORS Errors
- Ensure frontend is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Check CORS configuration in `main.py`

### 2. File Upload Issues
- Verify file size limits (10MB max)
- Check file type is in allowed list
- Ensure proper `multipart/form-data` encoding

### 3. Authentication Problems
- Verify token is not expired (30 min default)
- Include "Bearer " prefix in Authorization header
- Check token format and validity

### 4. Database Issues
- Run `python init_db.py` if tables are missing
- Check SQLite file permissions
- Verify sample data is loaded correctly
